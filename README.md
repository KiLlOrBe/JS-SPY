JS SPY
======
By developing this, I want to show how easy it is to track and stole personal informations by injecting a simple Javascript. The hacker has just to install an add-on/plugin on the victim's web browser which can inject every page the victim will visit with this script.

Peoples have to be more careful about their web browser, too many free software install add-on/plugin on our browsers without our agreement.

*Tested on Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer.*

*For testing purpose only.*

*I am not responsible for what you do with this script.*
